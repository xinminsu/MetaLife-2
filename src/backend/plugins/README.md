This directory contains "SSB plugins" for the backend. Typically these plugins are libraries, but in this folder's case, we have custom plugins intended only to support Manyverse. Often these plugins are called "utils" because they just add some conveniences on top of existing libraries. For instance `blobsUtils` adds some utilities that augment the library `ssb-blobs`.
